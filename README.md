# CrossbarSwitch_dim4

Arbitration algorithm - Round Robin

Dimension 4Ã—4 (4  Master Devises and 4 Slave Devices)

Target Device - Arty A7 (xc7a35ticsg324-1L)

Contains **two test modules** - disabled non-Synthesizable (test for Crossbar) file and Synthesizable (stimulus for Crossbar). The last of them is the top-module.

Contains **two constraints files**. Disabled file restricts frequency for the Crossbar itself (the design of crossbar requires little space of FPGA, whats why the main delay goes to achieve the degign)
